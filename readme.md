This is pathetic I know but, as someone recently said to me, there isn't much to do in the evenings these days.

## Graphs

To get directly to the data, look at the graphs directory. The data is plotted under two species - cumulative count of cases, and a seven-day average of cases. I've further divided these into with and without Dublin categories. The graph legends are clickable, meaning you can remove counties to make other counties' details clearer.


## Background
The data is sourced from the official Irish Government figures, as available here: https://covid19ireland-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/d9be85b30d7748b5b7c09450b8aede63_0.

### Dublin
Dublin is different from the rest of the country. When Dublin is included in the graphs, the other counties' details are smashed by Dublin's sheer volume, irrespective of whether we're looking at a seven-day average or the cumulative count.

### Population Proportion of Cases
The cases in one hundred thousand is a little bit of a showbiz stat - it looks more impressive than it is. The figure is got by taking the percentage of cases in each county, and then multiplying that percentage by one thousand. The reason for this, I suspect, is to make an impression.

Cavan has the highest PopulationProportionCovidCases with 1,526. That gets your attention in a way that 1.5% of the population of Cavan currently testing or having previously tested positive for the virus in six months doesn't.

### Meaning
God knows. One for the epidemiologists, I think. All I can do is count the things.
