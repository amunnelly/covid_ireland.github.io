# COVID-19 AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND

## Graphs

There are four graphs in the dataset. They are:
1. [Cumulative Cases by County](/covid_ireland/plots/ConfirmedCovidCases_cumulative.html). This is the raw data from [the official government source](https://covid19ireland-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/d9be85b30d7748b5b7c09450b8aede63_0).

2. [Cumulative Cases by County, excluding Dublin](/covid_ireland/plots/ConfirmedCovidCases_cumulative_no_dublin.html). Because Dublin is so much bigger than any other county, the detail of the other twenty-five counties gets lost. This the data above minus Dublin.

3. [Seven-Day Average of Cases by County](/covid_ireland/plots/ConfirmedCovidCases_seven_day_average.html). Again, from the official data, with a seven-day-average replacing the cumulative count. A seven-day-average because a daily count is very noisy.

4. [Seven-Day Average of Cases by County, excluding Dublin](/covid_ireland/plots/ConfirmedCovidCases_seven_day_average_no_dublin.html). Again, Dublin excluded to make the other counties' data clearer.

### Interacting with the Graphs
* Click counties on and off by clicking on the county name in the legend
* Hover over a line to see the county, date, and value (cumulative cases/seven-day-average, as appropriate)

## A Note on Population Proportion of Cases
The cases in one hundred thousand is a little bit of a showbiz stat - it looks more impressive than it is. The figure is got by taking the percentage of cases in each county, and then multiplying that percentage by one thousand. The reason for this, I suspect, is to make an impression.

Cavan has the highest PopulationProportionCovidCases with 1,526. That gets your attention in a way that 1.5% of the population of Cavan currently testing or having previously tested positive for the virus in six months doesn't.

## Meaning
Best left for the epidemiologists. All I can do is count the things. After that, I'm as lost as anyone else.
